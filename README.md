# Number_Line_1.0

## How to run 
To run the app go to the files and open the .exe file and wait for it to upload.

## Warning
There are a few bugs with the program like you can put a operator in first unless it is a negative otherwise it wont work and you will get an error in the code.
We will try to fix these problems in the next version.
