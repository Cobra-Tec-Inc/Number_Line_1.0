# Number_Line_1.0

## How to run 
Download the code, unzip the file, run the .exe file. I should recomend one thing DON'T try this on a Mac cause we only made it for Windows.

## Warning
There are a few bugs with the program like you can put a operator in first unless it is a negative otherwise it wont work and you will get an error in the code.
We will try to fix these problems in the next version.

## Tips and Tricks
- Dont put an operator befor a number unless it is a + or a - otherwise it wont work and you will have to reopen the app.
- There is a way to make "The Power of" by pressing the star button 2 times like this 3**3=27, but dont put it in more than 2 times.
- If you do end up putting an operator that is not - or + then restart the program.
- If you made a mistake that with putting a number in that you didnt want to like this you meant to do this "3+5" instead you make a mistake like this "3+50" or something like that DON'T press the clear button it isnt going to work for somereason, the correct way to clear it is complete the equation just press the = button if you have a complete equation, then resart.
